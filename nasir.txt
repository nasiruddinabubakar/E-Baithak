he latest OLED-equipped model of the Dell XPS 15 (version 9520, which starts at $1,449; $2,299 as tested) joins a long line of the company's flagship laptops 
and shows the state of the art in desktop-replacement systems. Armed with Intel's newest 12th Generation processors, Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics, and a beautiful OLED touch screen, 
this is one notebook that offers unbeatable productivity with visuals to match. It's not only one of the best office PCs on the market, it's a great option for video editing 
and media work, too. The XPS 15 OLED easily repeats as an Editors' Choice winner among deluxe content creation laptops. Dell's designers and engineers have worked hard to make the
 XPS 15 the platonic ideal of a full-size laptop. When closed, the simple bare-metal lid and chassis offer a stark profile. 
And if Dell's Platinum Silver finish isnâ€™t your style, you can always opt for Frost White, which gives the XPS an even more severe look but comes across as stylish, 
without being garish, in an office setting.#tech#laptop
